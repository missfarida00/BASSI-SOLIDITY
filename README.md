# Hi, I'm Farida

I'm a *Cybersecurity student* at the early stage of my tech journey, passionate about building secure systems and understanding how technology can be applied responsibly.

I have a growing interest in *smart contract development*, where I explore how blockchain technology can be used to create transparent, secure, and decentralized solutions.

Beyond coding, I actively *document my growth journey and create educational content* focused on technology, human development, and how both can integrate to solve real world problems. I believe knowledge sharing is a powerful tool for growth both personally and within the tech community.
